I am uploading my solutions here so others can observe my work.  In the code, I comment which was actually submitted.  The remaining code in the files show how I worked the solutions out.  Essentially, what worked and what didn't work.  When solving these problems I find that 4kyu's are tough, they can take a few days or a week to solve.  Some 5 kyu's are simple and some are harder than I expect and tend to take anywhere from an hour to two days.  3 kyu's are hard and in order to solve one on that level I need quite a bit of time or have the ability to talk to someone that can point me in a right direction.  I have yet to solve one of that difficulity.
