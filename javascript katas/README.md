I uploaded my solutions here so others can observe my work.  I comment which part of the code was actually submitted.  The remaining code in the files show how I worked the solutions out.  Essentially, what worked and what didn't work.  Sometimes I have to inch forward before I understand how to obtain the output I desire.  Sometimes I walk a mile or two around town when there was actually a trail leading straight to the store.  Other times, I get it right away.  My current level is 4kyu.  When solving these problems I find that 4kyu's are tough, they can take a few days to a week to solve.  Some 5 kyu's are harder than I expect, but tend to take a day or two.  3kyu's are hard and in order to solve one on that level I need quite a bit of time or have the ability to talk to someone that can point me in a right direction.  I have yet to solve one of that difficulity.
